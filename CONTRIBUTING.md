## Pick Your Quadrant

| Question | Quadrant |
|----------|----------|
| Does this automate busywork so I can focus on real thinking? | 🐹 **Hollow Victory** |
| Does this help me build something meaningful with my skills? | 🚀 **Purposeful Impact** |
| Does this give me structure when I feel directionless? | ⚓ **The Drift** |
| Does this enrich my life outside of work? | 🕯️ **Quiet Contentment** |

## Quality Standards

- **Clear problem statement** — What specific pain does this solve?
- **Structured approach** — Framework-based, not ad hoc
- **Professional outputs** — Would you put this in front of leadership?
- **Tested with real use cases** — Not just theoretical
- **Well-documented** — Another person should be able to use it in 5 minutes

## PR Review

We review all PRs within **48 hours**. Criteria:

1. **Quadrant fit** — Does the skill genuinely belong where it's placed?
2. **Quality** — Is the output professional-grade?
3. **Uniqueness** — Does it solve a problem not already covered?
4. **Documentation** — Can someone else use it immediately?

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. We're all trying to work smarter and live better.
