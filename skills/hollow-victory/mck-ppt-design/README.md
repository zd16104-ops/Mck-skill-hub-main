## What Problem Does This Solve?

Knowledge workers spend 40-60% of their working hours on slide formatting — adjusting fonts, aligning boxes, ensuring color consistency. This skill automates the entire design layer, producing professional-grade decks from structured content. **You focus on the storyline; the skill handles the pixels.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# Copy to your Claude skills directory
cp -r . ~/.claude/skills/mck-ppt-design/
```

## Usage

```
"Create a 10-slide strategy presentation for [Client Name] covering
market analysis, competitive landscape, and recommended next steps.
Professional style, navy and white color scheme."
```

The skill will:
1. Parse your content structure
2. Select optimal layouts for each slide
3. Apply the full Mck design system
4. Generate a production-ready .pptx file

## How It Works

The skill encodes a complete design specification:
- **16+ slide layout patterns** (title, agenda, two-column, big number, process flow, table+insight, etc.)
- **Strict typography hierarchy** (Georgia headers + Arial body + KaiTi Chinese)
- **Color-coded design tokens** (#051C2C Navy, #333333 Dark Gray, etc.)
- **Python-pptx code generation** with post-save cleanup to prevent file corruption
